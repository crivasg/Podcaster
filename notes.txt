Owner Drawn Controls

Typically the ListBox, ComboBox, and MainMenu controls display a series of text items. But with a little extra work you can make many of them display whatever you want. By making these controls owner-drawn, you can use your own code to draw the items in any way you like. They can display images, text, and other graphics drawn by your code, such as ellipses and polygons.

To use the Syndication  (System.ServiceModel.Syndication) namespace, add references to System.ServiceModel and System.ServiceModel.Web. If not, the following error will be present:

System.ServiceModel.Syndication or how to read RSS feeds in .NET

Today, a lot of websites have their content provided in feeds that users can subscribe to. Feeds basically are a simplified version of the site content, providing text and media –only representation of the data published on the website. One of the most popular feed formats is RSS and it stands for Really Simple Syndication. It is XML-based and is used by the majority of websites that contain dynamically updated content, like blogs or news resources.
